Stock Management Application (Object-Oriented Programming)
This is a simple Stock Management Application developed in Java, demonstrating the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
The application allows a small business to manage its inventory efficiently by performing operations like adding, updating, deleting, and displaying products.

Features:
Add a new product to the stock.
Modify existing product details.
Delete a product using its unique code.
Display a neatly formatted table of all products in stock.
Search for a product by name.
Calculate the total value of the inventory.

Technical Highlights:
Implements encapsulation through private attributes and public getters/setters in the Produit class.
Uses a static array to manage up to 100 products.
Includes basic input validation for a smooth user experience.
Interactive menu-driven console interface for user operations.

This project is a great example of applying OOP concepts like encapsulation, abstraction, and modular programming in Java.
